  <h4><font color="#fb6a4a">What's the conclusion?</font></h4>

  <h6><font color="#fb6a4a"> 1) No general trend to higher inequality</font></h6>
  <br>
  <h5>It's a mistake to think that inequality is rising everywhere. Over the last 25 years, inequality has gone up in many countries and has fallen in many others. It's important to know this. It shows that rising inequality is not ubiquitous, nor inevitable in the face of globalisation, and suggests that politics and policy at the level of individual countries can make a difference.</h5>

  <h6><font color="#fb6a4a"> 2) Note the diversity between countries  </font></h6>
